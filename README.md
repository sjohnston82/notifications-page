## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Astro
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first time using Astro. I have read a lot about it recently and decided to give it a go with this project. I learned a lot about its capabilities as well as several of its drawbacks. Mainly, this project probably wasn't ideal to try it out but it forced me to learn about nanostores, which Astro uses as a state manager. I found myself writing Astro components and then having to rewrite the component in React to get the state (mainly the read/unread state), to work properly. Overall it was a great learning experience.
